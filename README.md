# Employee Feedback Report Template

Recently, a coworker asked me for an Employee Feedback Report, which inspired me to create a template for all subsequent reports. Presently, the template is built solely in LaTeX, but I plan to automate it completely and upgrade its functionality by wrapping it in [PyLaTeX](https://github.com/JelteF/PyLaTeX) when I get the time.
